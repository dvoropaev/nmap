 *  your changes to fyodor@insecure.org for possible incorporation     *

 *  reuse, modify, and relicense the code.  This is important because  *
 *  the inability to relicense code has caused devastating problems    *
 *  for other Free Software projects (such as KDE and NASM).  Nmap     *
 *  will always be available Open Source.  If you wish to specify      *
