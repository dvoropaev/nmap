This is a description of the files in this directory, all of which have
to do with packaging on Mac OS X. They are useful only for those wanting
to build binary distributions of Zenmap for Mac OS X.

== Info.plist
A properties list file that whose contents are merged with the default
properties added by py2app.

== macports-1.7.0-universal.diff
This is a patch to apply to a MacPorts 1.7.0 ports tree to allow
building "universal" (dual-architecture) dependencies of Zenmap. As of
this writing, version 1.7.0 is available only as a Subversion checkout.
To build a universal environment, do the following:

1. Install MacPorts to be universal.
	export PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11/bin
	sudo mkdir /Library/Tcl/macports-universal-10.4 ./configure --with-universal-target=10.4 --with-universal-sysroot=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk
	make
	sudo make install
2. Set up a local ports tree.
	mkdir -p ~/macports-sources/ports/devel
	cp -R /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/devel/glib2 ~/macports-sources/ports/devel/
	mkdir -p ~/macports-sources/ports/lang
	cp -R /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/lang/python25 ~/macports-sources/ports/lang/
	mkdir -p ~/macports-sources/ports/python
	cp -R /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/python/{py25-hashlib,py25-libxml2,py25-numeric,py25-numpy,py25-sqlite3,py25-zlib} ~/macports-sources/ports/python/
	mkdir -p ~/macports-sources/ports/x11
	cp -R /opt/local/var/macports/sources/rsync.macports.org/release/ports/x11/gtk2 ~/macports-sources/ports/x11/
3. Patch the tree
	cd ~/macports-sources
	patch -p0 < macports-1.7.0-universal.diff
4. Build a port index.
	cd ~/macports-sources
	portindex
5. Edit the file /opt/local/etc/macports/sources.conf. Add a line
        file:///Users/user/macports-sources/ports/
   above the rsync line.
6. Edit the file /opt/local/etc/macports/variants.conf. Add a line
        +universal
7. Install the dependencies of Zenmap.
	sudo port sync ("sync", not "selfupdate", or you will get downgraded to 1.6.0!)
	sudo port install py25-gtk py25-sqlite3 py25-zlib

Note that you can reserve a separate MacPorts installation for the
universal environment; see http://guide.macports.org/#installing.source.multiple.

== make-bundle.sh
This script builds a .app bundle. It must be run from the root of the
Zenmap source tree.

== test_wrapper.py
This file contains unit tests for zenmap_wrapper.py, because it needs to
do some tricky escaping and substitution of configuration files.

== zenmap.icns
The icon file for the bundle. It was created using the Icon Composer
utility as described at
http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/08Configuring/chapter_8_section_5.html.

== zenmap_wrapper.py
This is a wrapper script that gets installed in the application bundle.
