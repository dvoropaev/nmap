Nmap currently includes a modified version of the tcpdump.org release
of libpcap version 0.6.2.  My (fyodor@insecure.org)
modifications are as follows:

-- Changed pcap-linux.c by adding a select() call guarding recvfrom()
   to insure that it returns after the timeout period specified in
   pcap_open_live() rather than blocking forever.

-- Eliminated Lex/Yacc requirement (I now ship the generated .c files)

-- The config.sub and config.guess have been upgraded (in the distribution
   file they are just symlinks to the corresponding files in the nmap dir
